# Soft Mask

## Description

Soft Mask is a powerful UI masking plugin for Unity UI (uGUI) that enables smooth masking transitions with alpha gradients. Unlike Unity's default UI mask, which creates hard edge transitions, Soft Mask allows you to create soft edges and partial masking effects. This makes it perfect for creating advanced UI effects like:

- Smooth gradient masks
- Soft edges on scroll views
- Fade-out effects on UI elements
- Partially transparent masked areas
- Multiple nested masks

The plugin is highly optimized for performance and works seamlessly with Unity's existing UI system.
